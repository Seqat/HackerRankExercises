Q10 : Grading Students

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

Rule 1:
-> If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, 
round grade up to the next multiple of 5.

Rule 2:
-> If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
