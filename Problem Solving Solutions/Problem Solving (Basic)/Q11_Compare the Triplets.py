HackerRank Problem Solving: Basic  Practice  (in Python3) 
Q11 : Compare the Triplets

    Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, 
awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and 
difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's 
challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] 
with b[2].

Rules:
-> If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.

-> If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.

-> If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.


Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.
